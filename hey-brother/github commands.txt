git clone url ->first of all we have to sync our project repository made on github.com in our 
                computer so that we can work on it.for doing that follow the below command.

copy the URL by getting into your repository on github.com
click on your repository---> <>code option --->clone or download option dropdown -->copy url

1>open cmd and browse to the location by using cd command where you want to place the repository
  in your computer.
2>type git clone (paste URL copied from above) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git pull ->it will show you the latest modified or created files by 
           other users inyour team.

git add -A -> it will add the changes made by you in the file in the 
              repository present in your system.

git commit -m "whatever be the message" ->after adding the modified 
              file to your repository in your system we have to commit 
              the changes .
              NOTE :after -m in "" i.e inside double qoutes we have to
              mention what changes we have did.so after commit the changes 
              in the file will be shown to you and others by the message.

git push -> after commiting the changes made to the file and saved it 
            in the repository in our system now its time to upload it 
            or sync it to our online repository in github.com.

NOTE:
1>if you commit using git commit command and if you didn't mention -m
 after commit then you will reach out to a new state in editor it is 
because git uses vi editor by default so to get out of the situation 
type command
esc(press esc key in keyboard rest you have to type):wq(then press enter)
